# Final Project Proposal: OpenGL Ray Tracer

## Task 1: Implementing basic ray tracing in shders to create a sphere with phong shading (10 points)
<p>The first task of this project is to simply create a sphere using ray tracing in Open GL and apply phong shading. The whole idea behind this task is to get familiar with how to incorporate ray tracing into shaders. </p>

## Task 2: Load the rabbit to replace the sphere, adding planes and apply more light sources (5 points)
<p>The second task of this project is to create the rabbit using the bunny OFF file using ray tracing. Planes and various light sources are also implemented. </p>

## Task 3: Applying soft shadow and area light to the bunny (5 points) 
<p>The third task of this project is to apply a soft shaow effect and area light effect to the bunny into the scene. </p>

## Task 4: Changing the material of the bunny to crystal (5 points)
<p>The fourth task of this project is to change the material of the bunny to a crystal bunny through adding refraction with proper index. </p>

----
## One of the below tasks will be implemented and the grading could be subjective evaluation of the complexity / final visual result.

## Extra Task 1: Adding fire to the scene (points various)
<p>Adding a fire source such as torch or bonfire to the scene to replace one of the front light source, adjust the phong shading accordingly. Dynamic moving fire might be implemented. </p>

## Extra Task 2: Adding melting effect on the bunny (points various)
<p>Adding a melting effect on the surface of the bunny according to the location of the fire. Change of shape might be implemented. </p>

## Extra Task 3: Adding rain to the scene and apply wet effects (points various)
<p>Change the weather of the scene to be raining. Wet effects might be applied to all objects as rain drop lands on the object.</p>
