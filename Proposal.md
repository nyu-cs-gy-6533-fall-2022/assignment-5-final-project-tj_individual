# Final Project Proposal: OpenGL Ray Tracer

## Task 1: Implementing basic ray tracing to create a sphere (2 points)
    The first task of this project is to simply create a sphere using ray tracing in Open GL. The whole idea behind this task is to get familiar with how to incorporate ray tracing into shaders.

## Task 2: Load the dragon OFF file from Assignment 4 to replace the sphere (3 points)
    The second task of this project is to load the dragon OFF file from assignment 4 to replace the sphere.

## Task 3: Incoporate phong shading, light source, and rotation with keyboard (5 points)
    The third task of this project is to implement everything we have done in the past assignments into the scene.

## Task 4: Changing the material of the dragon to transparent (5 points)
    The forth task of this project is to change the material of the dragon to a transparent texture while still be able to identify that is an object with all phong shadings.

## Task 5: Changing the material of the dragon to ice / glue (5 points)
    The fifth task of this project is to change the material of the dragon to either an ice dragon or glue-like dragon through either changing the surface diffusion to random diffusion or adding a texture wrapping to it.

## Task 6: Applying soft shadow to the dragon (5 points) 
    The sixth part of this project is to apply a soft shaow effect to the dragon into the sene.

## Extra task 1: Adding real-life planes into the scene (5 points)
    Adding planes as it is a real life scene. To make it more like a real life scene, planes will have views such as mountain and sky in the background. Everything appear in the background will not be implemented using objects but instead being hard coded with color calculation in back scenes. Depends on the depth setting of the back plane, calculations such as phong shading and reflection might provide unexpected results and might need adjustments/optimization in practice.

## Extra Task 2: Adding other OFF objects into the scene (5 points - 10 points)
    Finding other off objects such as fire hydrant, a pole to support the dragon so that it's not floating in the middle of the scene. The points varies based on the below standards:
1. Whether the objects are created using other frameworks and libraries, or they are pre-made OFF resources found from open sources.
2. The amount of objects in the scenes and they overlapping complexity of them. (Depth-of-field)
3. The other effects applied to other objects, such as mirror reflections.
    Base point for this task is to add at least 2 other off objects without much manipulations. Anything above 5 points will include at least one of the above complexity and will be specified depends on difficulties and complexities in practice. Every additional feature implemented will be clarified in the final report.
