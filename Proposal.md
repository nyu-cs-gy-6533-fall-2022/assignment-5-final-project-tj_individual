# Final Project Proposal: OpenGL Ray Tracer

## Task 1: Implementing basic ray tracing to create a sphere (1 point)
<p>The first task of this project is to simply create a sphere using ray tracing in Open GL. The whole idea behind this task is to get familiar with how to incorporate ray tracing into shaders. </p>

## Task 2: Load the dragon OFF file from Assignment 4 to replace the sphere (1 point)
<p>The second task of this project is to load the dragon OFF file from assignment 4 to replace the sphere. </p>

## Task 3: Incoporate phong shading, light source, and rotation with keyboard (2 points)
<p>The third task of this project is to implement everything we have done in the past assignments into the scene. </p>

## Task 4: Changing the material of the dragon to transparent (2 points)
<p>The forth task of this project is to change the material of the dragon to a transparent texture while still be able to identify that is an object with all phong shadings. </p>

## Task 5: Changing the material of the dragon to ice / glue (3 points)
<p>The fifth task of this project is to change the material of the dragon to either an ice dragon or glue-like dragon through either changing the surface diffusion to random diffusion or adding a texture wrapping to it. </p>

## Task 6: Applying soft shadow to the dragon (3 points) 
<p>The sixth part of this project is to apply a soft shaow effect to the dragon into the sene. </p>

## Task 7: Adding 2 more light sources to the scene (3 points)
<p>The seventh part of this project is to add two different light sources with different intensity, color, etc. The 2 light sources will be added from front and back. </p>

## Task 8: Adding real-life planes into the scene (5 points)
<p>The eighth part of this project is to add planes as it is a real life scene. To make it more like a real life scene, planes will have views such as mountain and sky in the background. Everything appear in the background will not be implemented using objects but instead being hard coded with color calculation in back scenes. Depends on the depth setting of the back plane, calculations such as phong shading and reflection might provide unexpected results and might need adjustments/optimization in practice. </p>

## Task 9: Adding 2 other OFF objects into the scene (5 points)
<p>The ninth part of this project is to add 2 other OFF objects such as fire hydrant, a pole to support the dragon, or an umbrella to cover the dragon. At least one effect such as mirror reflection will be applied to one of the objects.<p>

----

## Extra Task 1: Adding fire to the scene (5 points)
<p>Adding a fire source such as torch or bonfire to the scene to replace one of the front light source, adjust the phong shading accordingly.</p>

## Extra Task 2: Adding melting effect on the dragon (5 points)
<p>Adding a melting effect on the surface of the dragon according to the location of the fire.</p>

## Extra Task 3: Adding rain to the scene and apply wet effects. (5 points)
<p>Change the weather of the scene to be raining, apply wet effects to all objects in the scene if they are not covered by the umbrella.</p>
